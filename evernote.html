          I spent the summer after my sophomore year as a software engineering intern at <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>, where I split my time between the Growth Experiments and Business teams. The specifics of the work involved React, JS, Java, and HTML/CSS, along with rigerious planning and thought so as to seemlessly work with existing infrastructure. However, I found the more general aspects of working at my first software company to have been an even more valuable learning experience. <br>
          <br>
          The first half of my internship was largely characterized by one feeling: unfamiliarlity. I jumped into a codebase I didn't write, in a language I didn't know, with a work paradigm (experiments) I had never tried. Getting acustomed to JS and the idea of experiments came soon enough, but I was still without a thorough understanding of the codebase. Working through that unfamiliarlity forced me to improve two specific skills -- my ability to dig into and map out a codebase on my own, and determining when to ask for help. The former is still a work-in-progress, but I've made strides in being able to identify critical elements and understand interactions between different sections of code. The latter has helped make me a more productive member of teams.<br>
          <br>
          While implementing experiments were interesting, the projects were of smaller scope and more temporary in nature, leading to a conversation with my manager and a refocusing of my internship. In the second half, I joined a team working on bringing a release blocking feature to the web client. Though the project was made of smaller tickets that made the work seem, at first glance, similar to the type of work on the growth experiments team, each ticket was connected in a larger framework. This context gave each ticket more meaning, and also allowed me the opportunity to work on a project with lots of interdependant parts, making pre-planning and discussion more important than any line of code. <br>
          <br>
          My time at Evernote was spent learning and growing (pun intended), thanks to the help of my incredibily smart, talented, and open coworkers. I owe so much of my development as a software engineer to them. <br>
