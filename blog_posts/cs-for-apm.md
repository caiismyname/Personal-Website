## Introduction
I’ve been thinking about my growth as an APM at Yahoo, especially as someone who had absolutely zero PM experience coming into the job. In the following posts, I wanted to share three of the most important ideas that set up my CS → APM transition.

* You have to ❤️ what you’re building -- coding chops are great, but being successful in an APM role entails crafting a compelling narrative around your product and story.
* Side projects -- coding chops ARE great! Nothing builds rapport and empathy with your engineers 👩‍💻 like truly understanding what goes into a project.
* Work with the opportunities you have -- there’ll be plenty of time for TAM, roadmaps, and gaudy OKRs, but when you’re starting out, the more important thing is just to start ▶️.


## You have to love what you’re building
One of the biggest pitfalls I see when interviewing candidates is that they don’t have a compelling, genuine moment where they “discovered” PM. It doesn’t have to be grandiose -- my moment was realizing there were more interesting questions to ask beyond specifications of a class project -- but it has to be genuine.

Think hard 🧠 about why you want to become an APM. Is there a specific problem you can solve? Do you have an insatiable curiosity and a never-ending waterfall of ideas? There are no wrong answers as long as you have an answer that’s specific to you.

Don’t be shy about what’s driving you to the role; proudly share it even if an interviewer doesn’t ask. Skills and experiences can be learned on the job, but a true passion and love for a product has to be part of who you are.


## Side Projects
The best way to show your potential as an APM -- especially without a prior PM internship -- is through side projects. Side projects, when selected carefully, highlight many desirable traits in a potential APM:

* 📱Product sense -- fundamentally, did you build a good, compelling product that people could use and love?
* 🚢 Persistence and the ability to ship -- side projects are hard. They’re hard to start, hard to continue, and hard to finish. A Github full of a few small, completed projects is far more impressive than a sprawling graveyard of half-baked ideas, and infinitely more impressive than one with nothing at all. Shipping is in the job description.
* 💻 Engineering excellence -- no man is an island, and product ideas are nothing without a strong, engaged engineering team. A PM who is able to make informed engineering decisions and have intelligent conversations with their devs is a PM who will have the backing of their engineers -- they’ll respect you and, more importantly, you’ll respect them.

No project is too small for a side project. Focus on building something you would use and you would be proud of, see it through to completion, and the rest will take care of itself.


## Work with the opportunity you have 
I spent the first three years of college doing nothing but schoolwork. I knew in the back of my head that if I wanted to land an APM role, I needed something to prove it, but nothing ever felt right.

🚫 The idea wasn’t big enough.

🚫 The idea was too similar to an existing product.

🚫 I had school projects to finish.


Even during my internships, where I worked directly with established product managers and could easily reach out to many more for advice, direction, or just to chat, I didn’t.


⛔️ I didn’t have anything to back up my desire to be a PM.

⛔️ I didn’t know what to talk about.

⛔️ They looked kind of busy and probably wouldn’t want to talk with an intern.


This is not a recipe for success as a PM, and it definitely won’t land anyone an APM position. The solution is so obvious that I don’t even need to say it, but nonetheless I procrastinated and made up excuses until I convinced myself that I would take that first step, I would just do it “tomorrow”.

So I’ll help you out right now. Send me a message and I will chat with you. We can talk about your side project, your internship, your product sense, or what your second step should be because guess what? You just took the first step.
