                    <h2>Facebook, Summer 2018</h2><br>
                    <p class="indent">
                        At Facebook, I was an intern in the Developer Infrastructure organization in the Seattle office, specifically as a member of the <a href="https://prepack.io">Prepack</a> team. My project was to finish the debugger for the Prepack JS compiler -- the debugger had been started and basic functionality implemented last summer by another intern. Given no specific instruction, I had to explore the codebase to determine functionality was missing, and held meetings with my mentor and the rest of the Prepack team to determine what features would make the debugger a useful for them. <br>
                        <br>
                        I learned and experienced so many things from working at a large, tech-first company like Facebook. First and foremost, everyone there is incredibly smart. Like, friends with the guy who wrote my compilers textbook smart. It was inspiring to work with these engineers, listen to how they explain concepts and problems, and absorb how software engineering happens at some of the highest levels. I also got over my fear of asking questions to large groups -- everyone is so willing to help out, and often go above what I asked. And finally, I was exposed to the inner workings of one of the largest tech companies in the world and see all the underlying infrastructure and work that goes into supporting what seems like a simple website. <br>
                        <br>
                        While I ultimately chose not to return to Facebook in order to pursue a PM opportunity, I will take to heart the incredible engineering that I experienced.

                    <h2>Evernote, Summer 2017</h2><br>
                    <p class="indent">
                        I spent the summer after my sophomore year as a software engineering intern at <a href="http://evernote.com">Evernote</a>, where I split my time between the Growth Experiments and Business teams. The specifics of the work involved React, JS, Java, and HTML/CSS, along with rigorous planning and thought so as to seamlessly work with existing infrastructure. However, I found the more general aspects of working at my first software company to have been an even more valuable learning experience. <br>
                        <br>
                        The first half of my internship was largely characterized by one feeling: unfamiliarity. I jumped into a codebase I didn't write, in a language I didn't know, with a work paradigm (experiments) I had never tried. Getting accustomed to JS and the idea of experiments came soon enough, but I was still without a thorough understanding of the codebase. Working through that unfamiliarity forced me to improve two specific skills -- my ability to dig into and map out a codebase on my own, and determining when to ask for help. The former is still a work-in-progress, but I've made strides in being able to identify critical elements and understand interactions between different sections of code. The latter has helped make me a more productive member of teams.<br>
                        <br>
                        While implementing experiments were interesting, the projects were of smaller scope and more temporary in nature, leading to a conversation with my manager and a refocusing of my internship. In the second half, I joined a team working on bringing a release blocking feature to the web client. Though the project was made of smaller tickets that made the work seem, at first glance, similar to the type of work on the growth experiments team, each ticket was connected in a larger framework. This context gave each ticket more meaning, and also allowed me the opportunity to work on a project with lots of interdependent parts, making pre-planning and discussion more important than any line of code. <br>
                        <br>
                        My time at Evernote was spent learning and growing (pun intended), thanks to the help of my incredibly smart, talented, and open coworkers. I owe so much of my development as a software engineer to them. <br>
