## Introduction

PMs don’t write the code. We don’t make designs, write copy, perform research. If you really look at it, we seem to do very little.

Of course, that’s not how it actually is (I hope). PMs provide intangibles. Guiding a meeting to proper outcomes. Keeping up morale. Shielding the project from external requests. Just to name a few.

Mastering these intangibles have a lot to do with personal style, and are mostly developed through reps (though I’m sure you’ll read things claiming to teach you three easy tricks). This means that when we get the opportunity to produce the rare tangible output, we have to make sure it’s high impact. Here are three easy tricks to help:

- **Distribute meeting notes:** PMs trade in meetings, while everyone else despises them. Make sure the important takeaways aren’t lost in translation.
- **Always be BLUFing:** Bottom Line Up Front. Order your documents such that when people inevitably stop reading, they’ll always have the maximum takeaway no matter where they stopped.
- **Know your tools:** Mis-set permissions on a shared doc could be the difference between getting an approval vs. getting lost in the void.

_*Yes I understand PMs will fill in the gaps when needed. Let’s set that aside in the name of a more dramatic introduction._

## Meeting Notes

Talk is cheap. It's easy to discuss tons of ideas during a meeting but without a reliable system for accountability, the ideas will remain inert.

Here are the meeting notes best practices that I've found work for me. Use these as a starting off point for evaluating your own habits, not as decisive final form -- experiment to find what's best for you.

- **Notes are RAM, not HDDs:** Your goal should be to write down enough to jog your memory when you review your day. If the contents need to be distributed more widely, chances are you'll be creating a more formal document anyways.
- **Judicious inclusion:** Yes, notes should be concise. I want to talk about something else: meeting notes can be a place to park ideas that were brought up but were too derailing to discuss in the moment. Making mention of those ideas in your record of the meeting shows that you _really did_ remember someone's idea and will think about it, giving more weight to your `"Let's park that idea and come back to it"` line.
- **Become reliable:** Most of your meeting notes distributions will garner no response. Keep at it. It's not an inherently engagement-driving document, but being a reliable source of information for people will pay dividends.

## Always be BLUFing

In `Made to Stick`, the Heaths describe journalists' approach to structuring a story: Paragraphs should be in order of importance so if lines need to be cut, editors can just lop off the end.

Use the same approach to your informative* writing. Documents tend not to get read fully; they are closed the moment interest is lost. Your job is to ensure the maximum takeaway no matter where your reader stopped.

Some concrete examples:
- List action items first in your meeting notes
- Bring the meat of your proposals to the front of the document; make liberal use of an `appendix` section for everything else
- Don't rely on links. If the link says something important, pull it out into your main document.

_*This works best for straightforward informative documents. There is a time and place to pull out your other stickiness techniques._

## Know Your Tools

As people who live in GSuite, we need to be intimately familiar with the expressive power of every tool in our arsenal.

Others might not reciprocate the level of attention you give, but they will certainly feel the effects, consciously or not. Here are some of my favorite tricks:

- **Schedule-send emails:** Learn everyone's email-checking schedules and time your emails to maximize their read probability and good-mood probability.
- **Editing meeting invites:** GCal gives the option to send/not send and email update when changing an event. Want to make sure everyone sees the agenda? Make an edit to add the agenda, and copy it in the update message.
- **GDocs permissions:** Edit vs. Comment vs. Read send subtly different messages. Be intentional.
- **GDocs view stats:** You can see who has viewed your document, and when. It's that graph icon next to the bubbles that represent people currently viewing the doc.
- **First impressions:** Have you ever landed on spreadsheet with 20 tabs and inscrutable acronyms? What about a doc with a table-of-contents and a how-to guide? Depending on the level of interaction you want, you can be intentional with the usability of your docs.
