## Introduction

Coming from a CS/SWE background, I'm often asked how much of PMing is technical. Here are three aspects of how a technical background affects your job as a tech PM:

- **You don't code:** To get to the point, there are only very rare circumstance that would result in you writing code -- I have never done it. It's not an indictment of your programmer ability, it's just an effect of specialization.
- **You have to know what's going on:** You don't have to be able to build the whole product on your own, but you need enough familiarity and adaptability to hold fluent conversations with your dev team about the product.
- **Your level of abstraction is different:** The bar for "sufficient" is different for a PM than for a dev. You will interface with APIs rather than implementations.

Of course, every role is different and everything is on a continuum. These are merely rules of thumb for those interested in starting a PM career. If you have a different experience in your time as a PM, please share in the comments!

## You don't code

Don't expect to write code as PM. I have to stress that this isn't a judgement on your coding abilities. Rather, it's a recognition of your other skills.

If you're a PM, you are a master communicator, a bridge between eng and design/marketing/legal.

If you're a PM, you are the solider the team sends into meetings on their behalf.

If you're a PM, you are the intangible combo-multiplier that unlocks the abilities of the team.

If you're a PM, you may also be a skilled programmer, but to your team, you're the above first, and programmer-of-last-resort.

Focus on the areas where you can make sweeping, non-marginal gains, where no one else can do what you do as well as you can.

_PS if you enjoy coding for the sake of coding, a side project is a great place to satisfy that itch while also developing your product sense._

## You have to know what's going on

It goes without saying that to PM a tech product, you need to know your product. But products will differ in their tech stacks, and the chance you're familiar with the exact stack your team is working on is relatively rare.

Don't worry about focusing on specific languages, frameworks, or platforms. It's good know how the popular ones differ from each other, but these things change with time.

It's more important to have a broad base of understanding that any arbitrary concept can slot into. Dev teams are the subject matter experts, and you just need to speak the same language -- they'll help fill in the rest.

I know this rather vague definition won't answer many questions if you're coming from a completely non-technical background, so here's a (likely incomplete) list of useful, basic concepts:

- What's an API, what it's for, and what makes a good API
- A basic web-app stack: front-end, server, database
- Related to the above: JavaScript, Node, React
- Enough understanding that given a task, you can intelligently pick between JS, C, Java, Python, SQL
- What is machine learning, and what can / can't it do (yet)
- What DevOps do

A simple litmus test would be to point at any tech product you use daily and see if you can reasonably deconstruct how it might be built.

## Your level of abstraction is different

Coming from a SWE background, you may bristle when engineers describe things as "X for Y". Again, I have to stress that this isn't a judgement of your abilities as a SWE. It's just good API design.

Think about your job on the team vs. your engineers: You need to interface with the rest of the world, with other teams and products. You need to think about the future direction and evolution of a product.

None of these tasks are enhanced by a more detailed understanding of the underpinnings of your product and in some cases, you may even be bogged down carrying around these details.

At the same time, look at it from their perspective: No one wants to re-explain something that's expected to undergo constant change and evolution, and giving details that will soon be outdated can lead to the real-life cache-invalidation issues. Better to speak at a more stable, higher abstraction level that covers the what, not the how.
