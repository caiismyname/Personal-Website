## Introduction
I never had a PM internship. But after having all these conversations with current students who do have this opportunity, I wanted to reflect on what I would’ve done if I had had one.

- Explore: An internship is three months, then you’re out. Three months in a whole new environment, with people who have no preconceptions of you. Now is the time to figure out what the best version of you is.
- Feel: As a first time PM starting a full-time role, I experienced so many strange and uncomfortable feelings as I discovered what the role really was. Take this opportunity to get a head start on acclimating to the differences.
- Filter: In the first couple teams you work with, everything is new. It’s hard to tell what is a quirk of the team vs. what is intrinsic to being a PM. Learn to filter the ideas from the implementation.

Good to luck to all the new interns starting this summer! Please share this series with anyone you think may find it useful, and as always, follow for more posts in the series.

## Explore
I’m not advocating that you be purposely outlandish, but keep in mind that an internship is a blank slate.

Preconceptions are nonexistent, and expectations are loose at best.

This is the time to figure out what’s best for you.

As PMs, we emphasize the virtues of iteration, testing, and experimentation. Let’s practice what we preach.

Perhaps you want to shore up a skill you haven’t had the chance to practice, or perhaps you want to double down on your strengths. I’m not here to advocate a particular approach; I’m just saying to pick something and work on it.

Try new styles, new tactics, new catchphrases. They don’t have to be particularly unique or impressive. Maybe you can tackle some of the classic choruses you hear on LinkedIn:

>- Never eat lunch alone.
>- Take notes by hand.
>- Open every meeting with a joke.

Whatever it is, dive into it head first, and come out the other end with learnings for your next iteration.

## Feel
My first couple months as a PM were just a blur of confusion.

>“Am I being productive enough?”
“Am I asking enough questions?”
“What should I be doing right now?”

These are perfectly normal (and honestly, pretty healthy) feelings to have, but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier in the moment.

Then there are the tactile differences that come with taking on a PM role for the first time.

>“How do I run a meeting?”
“How do I find the nerve to speak up during a meeting?”
“What just happened in that meeting?”

These are perfectly normal (and honestly, pretty healthy) feelings to have, but knowing that doesn’t make it any easier in the moment.

I asked my mentors what to do about these feelings and questions and confusion, and the answer is what you’d expect: No one has answers, it just takes time.

So take your time. Allow yourself to examine your frustrations, your questions, your general emotions at the end of each day. Know that these aren’t “intern” feelings, they’re “everyone” feelings. 

And you’re getting a sneak peak.

## Filter
It’s easy to focus on the way your team does things, but as an intern your objective should be to separate the goal from the implementation.

The tools will change from team to team, but the needs will remain the same. Try looking at your day-to-day through the following lenses:

- What is the goal of this process, and what is its simplest form?

- When was the last time this process changed, and why?

- What are the jobs to be done on the team, and who do those responsibilities fall to?

Observe your team’s approach, your surrounding teams’ approach, your company’s approach.

Carry those fundamental ideas forward to your next job.
