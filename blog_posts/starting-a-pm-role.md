## Introduction
As I wrap up my first year and first rotation as an APM, I want to reflect on how I started my first rotation, what I learned, and what I'll be changing for my second rotation.

- **Take the time to understand:** When I started, I so was eager to start contributing and make an immediate impact that I didn't take the requisite time to fully understand the team and the product.
- **Develop relationships with everyone around you:** I did a round of 1:1s with everyone I could find within the first couple weeks, but this time I'll be more focused on what we talk about, and keep the ball rolling on those relationships.
- **Get a popular win:** Use your "starter project" as an opportunity to show you're paying attention to the team's perspective and ship something everyone can feel good about.

## Take the Time to Understand
PMs are eager by nature. It's that passion for the product that brought here in the first place, and it's natural to feel an urge to make an impact on day one. That's certainly how _I_ acted on my very first team.

I've heard about CEOs embarking on a "listening tour" during their first month with a new company. PMs are sometimes called "CEOs of their product" and in that spirit, I want to take my first couple weeks to just listen and observe.

I'll be listening for:
- What is each team member enthusiastic about, and what is the team excited about?
- Conversely, what do they dread? Processes, features, tech-debt-black-holes, anything's game.
- What was each team member most proud of last year, and what would it take to exceed that feeling this year?
- How do we define and measure success?
- How does each team member prefer to work with a PM?
- Who else should I talk to?

You'll notice the questions are people-focused rather than product-focused. In my first rotation, I believe I grandstanded too much on product decisions. Ideas are cheap, buy-in is hard; I want to build a more cohesive and unified product team.

## Develop Relationships
A large part of success as a PM comes from your ability to understand, connect with, and motivate your team. Reflecting on my previous rotation, there are a number of areas where I fell short:
1. Knowing each developer as a person
2. Soliciting honest feedback
3. Establishing a clear personality
4. And perhaps most importantly, being honest and upfront when I was uncomfortable or didn't know something

Here's how I plan to tackle each one:
1. Building social breaks. Oddly enough, my team's culture improved when, thanks to the COVID WFH, our engineering manager starting posting a different question every day in Slack. A regular "Share on something non-work" session maybe?
2. "Let me know anytime if you have any feedback" is not an effective feedback strategy. I will _proactively_ seek feedback on _specific items_ I am unsure of.
3. I felt reserved and hesitant because I didn't know how people would respond. See #1 for my solution.
4. This has improved as time goes on, but a technique I've found for myself is to reframe each instance not as "Oh shit I don't know, how do I cover that up", but rather "Good catch, let's go find out".

My first deliverable as a PM was a PRD summarizing what everyone else on the team already knew (since they were the ones who told me the info). Documenting is generally useful but in my specific case, this wasn't.

In choosing that PRD as my first step, I sent a few implicit messages:
- I'm prioritizing an idealized version of events over the actual necessities
- I'm prioritizing something that's useful _for me_ over something that's useful for the team
- I don't know what's going on

That last one is inevitable but the first two, which are not necessarily bad in some circumstances, didn't send a good "first month on the job" message.

This time around, I intend for my first deliverable to solve for the team. I don't know what that looks like yet, but it'll fall out of one of the questions I'll be actively trying to answer:

> What does each team member dread?

It could be a process everyone grumbles about, a pet feature that never got prioritized, or maybe even tech-debt that gets cut from the sprint, every sprint. Anything's game.

I want my first "PM move" to be one that shows I'm not just a PM for the product, I'm there for the team as well.
