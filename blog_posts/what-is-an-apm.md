## Introduction

`APM` is a popular new job title that has emerged in the past few years. For some, it‚Äôs become such a fixation that the term made its way into resumes and headlines. In this series, I want to share three different takes on what an APM program (and being an APM) really means.

- An APM is a new grad -- in job titles, ‚Äúassociate‚Äù tends to refer to someone junior. An _Associate_ Product Manager is, at its core, a junior level product manager. So what makes it different than being a Junior Product Manager?
- An APM is an investment -- in the same way internships are valuable to both the company and the intern, an APM is a two-way investment in the future of product management at a company. How does a company ensure it maximizes ROI?
- APM is just another job -- being an APM isn‚Äôt the only way to become a capital-P Product Manager. In many respects, being an APM is no different from any other tech role you could pursue out of college. What are other ways to achieve a product career without an APM title?

## An APM is a new grad

Marissa Meyer started the original APM program as a way to create her own PM talent (comparatively easy) instead of trying to find and hire pre-made PMs (hard).

You may meet APMs that hadn‚Äôt considered a product career until fairly late on (üôã‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èI‚Äôm one of them). They‚Äôll have been focused on engineering, design, marketing, data science, or fields that aren‚Äôt even in the realm of a traditional tech company‚Äôs purview.

What they have in common is the drive to be _really good_ at something, and the flexibility to reapply their skills towards a tech PM role.

A junior PM is a PM at the beginning of their PM career.

An APM is someone with the aptitude for problem solving, and is looking for an outlet to focus their efforts on.

I‚Äôll leave you with Marrisa‚Äôs original charter for the APMs:

>  ‚ÄúI wanna bet that I can hire new people right out of school and train them to be great product managers at Google faster than you can hire the people you prefer who are more experienced and senior.‚Äù

## An APM is an investment

Hiring a PM, from a supply/demand perspective, is a bit tricky. Hiring a PM that fits your culture, fills your team‚Äôs needs, and has the intangibles that make for a great PM? Good luck.

An APM program is an investment in a supply of good PMs. A good program should be the scaffolding that supports its members as they grow into skyscrapers, offering just the right mix of mentorship, structure, opportunity, and independence.

A good program should be built to maximize your growth and experience -- the taller your skyscraper, the higher their ROI.

At the same time, an APM program is an investment in your future. You have to live in your discomfort zone, face challenges head-on, and constantly fuel the drive to ensure ‚ÄúAPM‚Äù is a means and not an end.

A good APM should come out of the program a good PM. 

There is no doubt in my mind that the single most important aspect of an APM program is the support each APM is given. A strong, well-developed APM program that is built explicitly for its APM‚Äôs growth is one of the most valuable things a nascent PM can experience, regardless what company it‚Äôs at (though I‚Äôm partial to [Yahoo‚Äôs](https://yahooapms.com) üòÄ).


### APM is just another job

There‚Äôs a tendency to exalt the APM title beyond what‚Äôs useful. There will always be more capable APM candidates than there are positions, and while there‚Äôs no denying that programs are valuable, it‚Äôs crucial that you view it as a means and not an end.

With that mindset, you can tease out what the core components of an APM program are, and assemble one for yourself.

- **Mentorship**: As explained previously, mentorship is the key to skating where the puck will be. Find people who are where you ultimately want to be, find people who are on their way there, and ask them to guide you on your path.
- **Opportunity**: Choose your roles to maximize opportunities to take on PM responsibilities. Smaller startups tend to have more needs all around, and even as a SWE there should be plenty of work for you to start picking up.
- **Structure**: Set a goal for what you want to be, and when you want to be it, and filter all your decisions through that lens. Focused, prioritized work towards shipping a product is the core job of a PM anyways üòú.

Not landing an APM role doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt be a great PM. Not working through setbacks will, though.
