## Introduction
One of the biggest benefits afforded by an APM program is the amount of mentorship 👨‍🏫 available. You’re an investment to the company, and the company wants to give you your best shot to succeed. But having access to mentorship isn’t an automatic ticket for growth.

In the following posts, I’ll be sharing how I’m making the most of my mentorship opportunities as an APM.

- Recognize each mentor’s strength 💪  -- you’ll have a range of seniority in your orbit. Keeping each mentor’s current focus and past experience in mind will help maximize your relationship.
- Be 💯% honest in your representation -- a unique advantage of having a mentor outside of your direct manager is that they’re not involved in your performance evals. Being honest about your struggles and shortcomings will let them give truly useful advice rather than advice for a cleaned-up, idealized version of yourself.
- It doesn’t have to be a friendship, but be cautious about obsequiousness ⚠️ -- a mentorship will always have a formal undertone. That being said, you don’t want the relationship to look like a classroom where you hand in your homework at each meeting.

Mentorship is extremely valuable, especially at the start of a career. For those lucky enough to have access to the opportunity, make sure it doesn’t go to waste.

## Recognize each mentor’s strength
An important element of how Yahoo’s APM program structures its mentorship is that each APM has access to pretty much every stratum of experience. It’s laid out as follows:

**Day-to-day**: 👯‍♂️Your fellow APMs. These aren’t traditional mentorships, but there is comfort in sharing a new and unfamiliar experience with a tight-knit group.

**Mid-career**: 👨‍🦳A director-level PM within the company. These people run teams of people who run teams of people. Their days are different from yours, so take this opportunity to figure out what _they_ consider problems worth solving, and why those problems are hard to solve. A whole new set of challenges materialize at their level, and the more you can pull back the curtains on how your company’s direction is set, the better you can skate to where the puck will be.

**Professional**: 👩‍💼Some APM programs (including ours) set you up with a professional coach. This is an _incredible_ luxury. Make a backlog of every single thing you don’t feel comfortable doing, prioritize it like a project, and hone and practice and woodshed until you’re a pro. Skills you develop and polish here are hard to learn on your own, and will pay dividends as you grow.

*This isn’t a prescriptive layout for how _you_ “need” to go about mentorship.


## Be 100% honest in your representation
Every PM fails. The difference between the good ones and bad ones is that the good ones are honest about what they failed at, why they failed, and work honestly to improve.

This is your first job. For you, this is the largest team you’ve worked with, for the longest time, on the biggest project, with the biggest budget, and so on. To blame and explain away your missteps is to be naive about who you are right now.

Pretending that everything is fine and that you have nothing to talk about will lead you to talk about nothing. If you read my previous post, you should know how much you’re throwing away.

Being honest about what you forgot, mis-judged, procrastinated, felt uncomfortable doing isn’t a sign of failure. It’s a signal that you’re serious about improving, and a good mentor will parlay that into ways to help you.


## Be cautious about obsequiousness

You’re not in school anymore. The mechanics of assignments and grades don’t exist anymore. Just shame and guilt.

During my first meetings with my mentors, I would lay out a problem I was experiencing, they’d prescribe their advice, and I’d say “Ah, that makes sense. Thank you. I’ll be sure to do that from now on.”

Stiff, right? Nothing says “I won’t be doing any of this” like “I’ll be sure to do that from now on.”

You shouldn’t feel beholden to anything a mentor tells you. They’re not a panacea for all your work problems. Their advice worked for them, and maybe even worked for others, but that doesn’t necessarily mean it’ll work for you.

Your job isn’t to tell them that they’re right.

Your job is to get answers that work for you and if that doesn’t happen on the first try, push back.

Clarify.

Ask for alternatives, for examples, to role-play it out.

Keep going until you get something that you know will work for you.

Otherwise, you’re just wasting everyone’s time.
